# PICAT Connect4

This was a project for a class on emerging languages.
PICAT is not an emerging lanuage.
PICAT is poorly documented and coufusing and does not have any use case in the modern day, do not use it.
This project will remain here though because it is interesting to look at how things can be done even when the tools you are working with were not designed for it.
This is more like looking at an esoteric language.
